skill_scape_graph is using old data that I used to draw the skill edges.


Information about occupations will be scraped from https://joboutlook.gov.au/occupations/


What we want:
Economic resilience by SA2 (as map overlap which pulls up the state level explainer.)
State level skills network showing connections. 
How is resilience calculated?
A lookup table of information about the occupations and skills.
Unemployment over time by SA2?

## Data Notes:

From 2016 Census (using the [Census TableBuilder](https://auth.censusdata.abs.gov.au/webapi/jsf/login.xhtml)):

OccMinorGroupvsSA2PUR2016.csv is the Occupation Minor Group (2 digits) by SA2 area in South Australia counting people that have that SA2 as their place of usual residence (PUR) taken from the 2016 census.

Occ4DigitvsSA2PUR2016 is the same but with occupation (4 digits)



[Place of Work (POW)](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/2901.0Chapter47402016)
